\subsection{Additional training details}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Training configuration and hyperparameters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sparsity / reconstruction trade-off
    \end{itemize}
    \item Results of sweeps
    \item Hardware specs and details from training runs
\end{itemize}

We systematically analyzed the effect of X on reconstruction quality and feature interpretability across all three datasets.
