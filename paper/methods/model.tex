        \textbf{MINI's sparse dictionary neural network architecture.} \\
        \small (\textbf{a}) Natural features $x$ get encoded by neural activity $y$. (\textbf{b}) A sparse dictionary neural network attempts to recreate neural activity $\hat{y}$ from $y$. If $\hat{y}$ tries to recreate $y$ exactly, then the model is an autoencoder, while in other situations it may be a transcoder or crosscoder. ()\textbf{c}) A Matryoshka spare dictionary neural network segments the latent space into multiple levels, each of which attempts to do a full reconstruction of the target neural activity. In this case, latents exclusive to the highest-level will often correspond to high-level features (e.g. a round object), while latents exclusive to the lowest-level will often correspond to low-level features (e.g. a basketball).
