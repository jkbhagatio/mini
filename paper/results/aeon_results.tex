\subsection{Natural mouse spike data in an ethological foraging assay}

- We analyze data from the Aeon project, which provides continuous long-term recordings of freely behaving mice in enriched environments. This dataset allows us to study neural dynamics during naturalistic behaviors over extended time periods, from minutes to weeks.

- Brief dataset info...

- Features found and decoding accuracy comparisons with LangevinFlow and CEBRA...
