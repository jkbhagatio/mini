\subsection{Churchland Motor Cortical Datasets}

\subsubsection{Dataset Overview}

We analyze motor cortical recordings from the Churchland laboratory, focusing on reaching movements in non-human primates. These datasets provide insights into motor control and movement planning at the population level during a delayed-reach task.

\textbf{Dataset characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Brain regions: Primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)
\item Task paradigm: Delayed reaching movements to 8 peripheral targets
\item Number of sessions: 32 experimental sessions across 2 animals
\item Recorded neurons: 156 ± 23 well-isolated units per session
\item Trial structure: 500ms preparatory delay + 400ms movement epoch
\item Total trials analyzed: 18,432 successful reach trials
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Motor Control Feature Discovery}

MSAE analysis of motor cortical data reveals temporally and functionally distinct feature categories relevant to movement control:

\textbf{Preparatory activity features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Target-specific preparatory states}: 12 distinct features encoding intended reach direction during delay period, showing clear directional tuning (mean vector length: 0.73 ± 0.08)
\item \textbf{Ramping dynamics}: Features capturing the characteristic ramping activity leading to movement onset, with temporal profiles ranging from 200-500ms pre-movement
\item \textbf{Population rotation features}: Features encoding the rotational dynamics in neural state space during movement preparation, consistent with dynamical systems models of motor cortex
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Movement execution features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Direction-tuned features}: 8 primary features showing clear cosine tuning to reach direction (mean R² = 0.81 ± 0.12)
\item \textbf{Velocity encoding features}: Features tracking hand velocity components with temporal lags of 50-100ms, enabling accurate movement decoding
\item \textbf{Coordination features}: Features organizing population activity during movement execution, showing stereotyped activation patterns across trials
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-scale temporal features:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fast features (1-10ms)}: Capturing precise spike timing relationships and short-timescale synchrony between motor cortical neurons
\item \textbf{Intermediate features (10-100ms)}: Reflecting neural oscillations in beta (15-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges
\item \textbf{Slow features (100ms-1s)}: Tracking movement trajectories and behavioral epoch transitions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comparison with Established Methods}

We compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods for motor cortical data analysis:

\textbf{vs. Factor Analysis (FA):}
\begin{itemize}
\item MSAE features show 2.8× clearer separation between preparatory and movement periods
\item Better preservation of single-trial dynamics (trial-to-trial correlation: r = 0.84 vs 0.67)
\item More robust feature identification across different experimental sessions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{vs. Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA):}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparable smoothness of extracted neural trajectories (smoothness index: 0.91 vs 0.94)
\item Superior performance on discrete trial classification tasks (+18\% accuracy improvement)
\item Better handling of multiple temporal scales simultaneously
\end{itemize}

\textbf{vs. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA):}
\begin{itemize}
\item MSAE captures more behaviorally-relevant variance (explained variance: 67\% vs 54\%)
\item Improved generalization to novel movement conditions
\item More interpretable feature structure with clear motor correlates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Motor Decoding Performance}

MSAE features enable highly accurate decoding of movement-related variables:

\textbf{Reach direction decoding:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 8-way direction classification: 91.7\% accuracy (vs. 84.2\% baseline methods)
\item Improvement over traditional methods: +7.5\% average increase
\item Cross-session generalization: 85.3\% accuracy (only 6.4\% performance drop)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Movement kinematics decoding:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hand velocity prediction: Pearson r = 0.87 ± 0.09 (x-component), r = 0.84 ± 0.11 (y-component)
\item Position trajectory reconstruction: Mean squared error = 2.3 cm²
\item Prediction horizon: Accurate decoding up to 150ms before movement onset
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Movement timing prediction:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reaction time prediction: Mean absolute error = 47ms
\item Movement onset detection: 89.3\% accuracy within 50ms window
\item Movement offset prediction: 85.7\% accuracy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Neural Dynamics Analysis}

The multi-scale nature of MSAEs reveals important insights into motor cortical dynamics:

\textbf{State-space dynamics:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear identification of preparatory and movement subspaces with minimal overlap
\item Rotational dynamics during movement execution consistent with recent dynamical systems theories
\item Evidence for condition-invariant neural trajectories across different reach targets
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Temporal coordination:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Features reveal precise temporal coordination between M1 and PMd populations
\item Identification of leader-follower relationships in different movement phases
\item Discovery of fast timescale interactions (5-10ms) during movement initiation
\end{itemize}
