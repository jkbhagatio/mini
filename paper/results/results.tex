\section{Results}
\label{section:results}

- We evaluate MINI on one synthetic single-unit dataset with ground-truth latents, and three real extracellular electrophysiology, open-source, high-yield, single-unit datasets, across multiple, distinct brain regions in multiple species. (See \nameref{subsection:additional_dataset_info} for additional dataset details.)

- Overall, we show that MINI can:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Discover discrete and continuous, environmental and behavioral features
    \item Robustly find same features across time and subjects.
    \item Find features across different timescales (i.e. that persevere for different durations)
    \item Find hierarchical features.
\end{enumerate}    

- On the synthetic dataset, we show that MINI can recover all ground-truth latents, and use them to decode natural features of interest.

- On one natural dataset, we compare MINI to other popular approaches that have also been applied to the same dataset, and show that MINI more clearly reveals certain features than these other methods, while maintaining high reconstruction and decoding accuracy.

- On the other two natural datasets, we show that MINI can reveal expected and unexpected features (optinally / time-permitting, that CEBRA and LangevinFlow don't find), highlighting its use as a powerful tool for neuroscientific discovery.
